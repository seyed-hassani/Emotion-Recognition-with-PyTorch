# Emotion-Recognition-with-PyTorch
This project trains a deep learning model to recognize human emotions from grayscale facial images. Using transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet-18 model, we classify facial expressions into seven categories: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise, and Neutral.
